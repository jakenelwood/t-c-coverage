This file exists to signal to Cloudflare Pages that we're aware of the nested middleware issue
and are taking steps to fix it. The build process should:

1. Delete any nested middleware files (pages/api/_middleware.js)
2. Create a root middleware.js file
3. Run the Next.js build with Cloudflare adapter

Our cloudflare-build.sh script handles all these steps.

It's important that Cloudflare's build process uses this approach rather than 
attempting to build with the existing files in the repository.
